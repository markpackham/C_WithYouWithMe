/*
Definition and Declaration: Unions are defined using the union keyword, and they allow different data types to occupy the same memory location.

Initialization and Access: You can initialize and access union members using the dot operator. However, remember that only one member can be valid at a time.

Shared Memory: All members of a union share the same memory space, so changing one memberâ€™s value affects all others.
